# Prototype Motherboard

Plans for a prototyping board that can be seated onto a simple to construct plywood motherboard.

* Make a prototype board for PCB breadboard work
* Can use perfboard to start the design
* Make modular design for prototype board e.g. daughter boards for audio, pots, switches, flight control
* Board should have power supply with charge pump, positive and negative rails with 12v, 9v, 5v and 3.3v. May include ability to supply negative volatges.
* Lay it out as A3 for board placement
* Can use KiKad to make pcb designs to help with part placement
* Use layers in Inkscape or similar to work out routing requirements
